# Chapter 5 – Leveraging Knowledge Entries
> Teach Manus about your project so it can inject the right context automatically.

## 1. Key Concepts
- The Knowledge tab lets you store up to 20 snippets of custom text.
- You can enable or disable each snippet per task.
- Manus adds active snippets to the prompt before planning your run.

## 2. Hands-on Walk-through
1. **Step** – Open the Knowledge tab and add a short rule like "Confirm before proceeding." Attach a screenshot if desired.
2. **Observe** – Create a task with that snippet enabled and watch how Manus references it in the plan.
3. **Variations** – Toggle snippets on or off to see how responses change.

## 3. Best Practices
- Keep snippets concise; Manus combines them with your prompt.
- Group related snippets so you can enable them as sets.
- Periodically prune outdated information to save space.

## 4. Try-it-Yourself Exercise
- Add a knowledge entry describing your favorite writing style.
- Run a Create task and confirm the output matches that style.

## 5. Recap & What’s Next
- Knowledge snippets customize Manus without needing long prompts.
- Enabling only what you need keeps runs focused.
- Next we’ll explore each task category in depth.
