> Learn which tools Manus uses for each type of assignment.

## 1. Key Concepts
- **Create** covers design assets, slide decks and sound effects.
- **Analyze** handles data models and schedules.
- **Research** gathers information from the web and papers.
- **Code** generates or refactors software projects.

## 2. Hands-on Walk-through
1. **Step** – Run one task in each category using simple prompts.
2. **Observe** – Note how Manus selects different tools and models for each run.
3. **Variations** – Combine categories in a multi-step task to see how planning adjusts.

## 3. Best Practices
- Choose the closest category to reduce unnecessary steps.
- For large analyses, break work into smaller subtasks.
- Review code output with your own linter or tests.

## 4. Try-it-Yourself Exercise
- Attempt a Code task that scaffolds a small web app.
- Confirm that Manus sets up the repo and main files correctly.

## 5. Recap & What’s Next
- Categories map to different tool chains.
- Tailoring your request to the right category saves credits.
- Next we’ll focus on crafting multi-step prompts.
