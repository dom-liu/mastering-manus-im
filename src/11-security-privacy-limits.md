# Chapter 11 – Security, Privacy & Limits
> Understand how Manus protects your data and enforces safe content policies.

## 1. Key Concepts
- Manus runs tasks in sandboxed environments to isolate files and code.
- Data retention is limited and logs can be purged on request.
- Safe content handling prevents sharing sensitive information. See [axios.com](https://axios.com) for industry perspectives.

## 2. Hands-on Walk-through
1. **Step** – Review the security settings in your account dashboard.
2. **Observe** – Note how Manus separates workspaces and provides log download options.
3. **Variations** – Opt out of sharing anonymized data to see how this changes analytics.

## 3. Best Practices
- Avoid uploading private keys or credentials into tasks.
- Regularly clear old runs from the log if they contain proprietary data.
- Respect rate limits to keep the system stable for everyone.

## 4. Try-it-Yourself Exercise
- Run a task that processes a sensitive file and then delete the log.
- Confirm the file is no longer accessible in the workspace.

## 5. Recap & What’s Next
- Sandboxing and retention limits keep your data safer.
- You control how much telemetry is shared with the developers.
- Finally, let’s look at the Manus road-map and how to contribute.
