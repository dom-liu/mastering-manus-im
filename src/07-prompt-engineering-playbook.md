# Chapter 7 – Prompt Engineering Playbook
> Craft multi-step instructions that guide Manus toward precise results.

## 1. Key Concepts
- Break big goals into ordered steps with clear outcomes.
- Attach files when source material is needed.
- Manus automatically asks clarifying questions but you can override with directives.

## 2. Hands-on Walk-through
1. **Step** – Write a prompt that includes numbered steps and a file attachment.
2. **Observe** – Manus reviews the steps, asks follow-up questions if necessary and then executes.
3. **Variations** – Add guard-rails like "Do not publish without approval" to shape behavior.

## 3. Best Practices
- Provide specific success criteria in your steps.
- Reference knowledge snippets rather than retyping long context.
- Encourage Manus to confirm ambiguous points before proceeding.

## 4. Try-it-Yourself Exercise
- Draft a three-step instruction for researching and summarizing a topic.
- Validate that Manus outputs the summary in the requested format.

## 5. Recap & What’s Next
- Structured prompts lead to more reliable runs.
- Files and guard-rails keep Manus focused.
- Next we’ll explore community templates to accelerate tasks.
