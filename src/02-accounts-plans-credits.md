# Chapter 2 – Accounts, Plans & Credits
> Understand how Manus credits work so you can manage costs from day one.

## 1. Key Concepts
- Every new user starts with 1,000 welcome credits and a daily refresh of 300 credits.
- Paid tiers unlock higher limits and faster refresh rates.
- Each task burns credits based on complexity and runtime. See [manus.im](https://manus.im) or [medium.com](https://medium.com) for detailed pricing updates.

## 2. Hands-on Walk-through
1. **Step** – Sign up for a Manus account using your email.
2. **Observe** – The dashboard displays your available credits and refresh timer.
3. **Variations** – Upgrade to a paid tier or wait for the daily refresh to see how credit balances update.

## 3. Best Practices
- Plan tasks in advance to avoid burning credits on trial-and-error.
- Track credit usage under the account settings page.
- Consider a subscription if you regularly run long jobs.

## 4. Try-it-Yourself Exercise

- Confirm that your credit balance decreases and refreshes as expected.

## 5. Recap & What’s Next
